/**
 * @file ConcurrentOrderDemo.cpp
 * @brief Demonstration of concurrent order processing using threads
 * 
 * This program demonstrates:
 * 1. Multiple customer orders being processed simultaneously using threads
 * 2. Staff availability management with proper synchronization
 * 3. Chain of Responsibility functioning under concurrent load
 * 4. Thread-safe inventory management
 * 5. Proper resource allocation and release
 * 
 * Key Concurrency Concepts Demonstrated:
 * - Thread creation and management using pthread (C++98 compatible)
 * - Mutex synchronization for shared resource access
 * - Condition variables for thread coordination
 * - Race condition prevention through proper locking
 * - Deadlock prevention through consistent lock ordering

    std::cout << "   • Threads are created simultaneously and compete for resources" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Proper thread cleanup prevents resource leaks" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "2. STAFF AVAILABILITY & CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Limited staff members (3) must handle multiple concurrent orders" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Orders wait in queue when staff is unavailable" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Chain of Responsibility processes orders in correct sequence" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Staff allocation and release is tracked in real-time" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "3. SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISMS:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Mutex locks prevent race conditions on shared resources" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Separate mutexes for staff, inventory, and logging operations" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Condition variables coordinate thread completion" << std::endl;

    std::cout << "4. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Thread-safe inventory access prevents overselling" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Staff resources are properly allocated and released" << std::endl;

    std::cout << "   • Staff is properly allocated and released without deadlocks" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Queue management works correctly under resource constraints" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "2. CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY EFFECTIVENESS:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Each order follows the complete processing chain" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • No orders are dropped or processed incorrectly" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Concurrent access doesn't break the chain sequence" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "3. RACE CONDITION PREVENTION:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • No inventory items were oversold" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Staff count remained consistent throughout" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Log messages are properly synchronized (no garbled output)" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "4. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Smaller orders completed faster (as expected)" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Large orders took proportionally longer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "   • Overall throughput improved due to parallelization" << std::endl << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "5. SYSTEM RELIABILITY:" << std::endl;
